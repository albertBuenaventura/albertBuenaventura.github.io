# Why?

There are two reasons on why I created this blog.

1. I'd like to improve my writing skills. I always wanted to give back to the tech community with the practices I know by expressing my ideas and thougths thru writing. 

2. I believe with the saying that `If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough` of Albert Einstein. Well I think, that's self explanatory! win-win!
